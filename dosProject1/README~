Test Results


<<<-----------------------------------------Before running the code ------------------------------------------>>>
Go to dosProject1/src/main/resources and edit the application.conf file
for running the server code, 
	put server machine's ip address in hostname field of RemoteActor
for running the client code - 
	put client machine's ip address in hostname field of LocalActor 	


<<<-----------------------Command to run the code - (assumes that sbt is added to PATH)----------------------->>>
Go into dosProject1 directory and type the following command
	$ sbt  
This will give you an sbt console
	> publishLocal
	> runMain bitcoin.project1 <args0>
	(args0 for server program is number of zeroes required)
	(args0 for client side is ip address of server)
The code runs for 5 minutes and then prints results and terminates gracefully


<<<------------------------------------------------TEST SYSTEM-------------------------------------------------->>>
Hardware - 
Cluster of 3 Intel Q57 Express Machines
CPU - Intel Coreâ„¢ i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80GHz 
Number of Cores - 8 
RAM - 16GB

Network - Broadband Network. All machines were connected to an ethernet switch.

	
<<<-----------------------------------Summary and Analysis of Results---------------------------------------->>>
Runtime for testing - 2 minutes
Number of Machines used - 3
Maximum number zeroes for which bitcoins were mined - 7

For large loads, number of Bitcoins increased almost linearly as number of machines was increased from 1-3. This is expected because message overhead is less. For smaller loads, number of bitcoins increased non-linearly with number of machines. This is expected because message overhead is high

Number of Bitcoins mined decreased as load on every machine increased. This was not expected because as load on each machine increases, number of messages passed between machines decreases. But this phenomenon might be due to various reasons like - 
	1. Fast network
	2. Complexity of code that mines bitcoins
	3. Size limitation of BigInt (used to define Load)

CPU Time = (approximately) 7.5 times Real Time when run from sbt console
CPU Time = (approcimately) 4.5 times Real Time when run from console 
CPU Time vs real time calculation was obtained by running the code on console with "time" command.
